# Differentitator
This is my realization of basic math problem: differentiation, tailor rows, tangent equations and even graphics. Unfortunately, now my differentiator parses equations only full bracket sequences. But I'm looking forward to rewrite it using recursive descend ([you can check an example here](https://github.com/ThreadJava800/Recursive-descend)).

My program generates a .tex file with all the transformations done on equation. To reduce amount of writing in pdf file, I also realized a function
